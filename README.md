# shopping
This is a project part of the course CS50AI. I have only written the 3 main functions: load_data(), train_model(), evaluate().
The program predicts whether a user intends to make a purchase or not in a given website given information about a user session such as how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. (all data needed are in the shopping.csv file). 
It uses the machine learning model Nearest-neighbor classifier, which is implemented using the scikit-learn library.
